# Nextflow Snippets

Snippet is a programming term for a small region of re-usable source code, machine code, or text, and Nextflow is both a Domain-Specific Language for writing data pipelines and a pipeline orchestrator. For more information about Nextflow, check the official [site](https://www.nextflow.io) and [documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/). For community training material, [this link](https://training.nextflow.io) is a greaaaaaat place to start! :smiley:

This repository contains a collection of numerous solutions I have worked on throughout the past months as a Nextflow and nf-core Developer Advocate at [Seqera Labs](https://seqera.io) providing community support to numerous users around the world. I haven't saved all the snippets I created, but as I have now answered over 500 questions in this period, there are indeed quite a few I have kept when I found the solution interesting enough :satisfied:
