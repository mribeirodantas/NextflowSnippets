Snippet is a programming term for a small region of re-usable source code, machine code, or text, and Nextflow is both a Domain-Specific Language for writing data pipelines and a pipeline orchestrator. For more information about Nextflow, check the official [site](https://www.nextflow.io) and [documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/). For community training material, [this link](https://training.nextflow.io) is a greaaaaaat place to start! :smiley:
